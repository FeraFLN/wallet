# Wallet Table Game Project

This project, **Wallet**, was developed as a personal learning experience to understand and implement **WebSockets** using Java and Node.js, and also learn ReactJS. The project simulates a digital wallet designed to be used in table games like **Monopoly**, providing functionalities for managing virtual money transactions during gameplay.

## Key Features

1. **WebSocket Integration**:
   - Real-time communication between clients and the server.
   - Instant updates for wallet transactions, ensuring synchronized gameplay.

2. **Wallet Management**:
   - Add or subtract funds for individual players.
   - View the current balance of each player's wallet.

3. **Multi-Platform Support**:
   - Built with Java and Node.js to explore different approaches and frameworks.

4. **ReactJS Frontend**:
   - Created a user-friendly interface to interact with the wallet system.
   - Implemented components for real-time updates and transaction management.

5. **Table Game Use-Case**:
   - Simplifies financial transactions in games like Monopoly.
   - Reduces the need for physical cash or banknotes during play.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**:
  - Implemented WebSocket server functionality to handle real-time updates.
  - Managed server-side logic for wallet operations.

- **Node.js**:
  - Created an alternative server implementation for comparison and flexibility.
  - Handled client-side communication using WebSocket libraries.

- **ReactJS**:
  - Developed the frontend interface for seamless user interaction.
  - Leveraged state management and component-based architecture to enhance usability.
